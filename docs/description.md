The Tangram Composition Description
===================================

The Tangram Composer is a server/edge side HTML composition service. It tries  to solve the microservices frontend problem faced when you build a microservices distributed system, each microservice with it's own lifecycle and rollout. In this scenario it's usual to build the user system's user interface as a monolith, aggregator of microservices data. This model creates user interface-microservices one to one dependencies, so in a lot os cases the rollout of each piece is bound, then the service autonomy is harder and going to continous deployment is compromissed.


## TBD & Ideas

> The Tangram Composer is a solution to the Distributed Composition problem faced when building a GUI within a Micro Services Architecture. 

> Tangram is an HTTP router and reverse proxy working as edge-side/server-side HTML composition service. Is designed to work as stateless service.

> An edge-side microfrontends composition solution.
